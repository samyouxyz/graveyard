# SlingRage
Basic slingshot in SpriteKit (Xcode 7)

This is a tiny code just to play around with the basic of SpriteKit in Swift.
What the code does is having a ball (weaponNode) that is slung back and project to touch a certain object (enemyNode).
The enemyNode will disappear upon collision.

Code is mostly in **Gamescene.swift**
